- is f a function from R to R if

  - f(x) = 1/x?
    - false. the value is undefined for 0.

  - f(x) = +/- sqrt(x^2 + 1)
    - false. it gives 2 images for a given preimage. for each preimage in the domain, the function must map to only one image in the codomain.

- is f a function from Z to R if

  - f(x) = +/- x
    - false. 2 images for a given preimage

  - f(x) = |sqrt(x2 + 1)|
    - true. there is absolute value taken, and returns only one image for each preimage. additionally, no opp to take sq root of negative num

  - f(x) = 1/(x^2 - 4)
