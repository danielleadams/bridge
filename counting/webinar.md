For sets A & B, we say that |A| = |B| if a bijection exists.

### Sum Rule

- Let A, B be 2 disjoint sets (the intersection of A and B is empty). We have |A âˆª B| = |A| + |B|.
- Example can be that 8 girls and 10 boys equals 18 students.

### Product Rule

- If a task can be broken into k steps, so that there are n(1) ways to do first step. There are n(2) ways to do second step. Regardless of the outcome of the first step, if there are n(k) ways to do k-th step. Then, there are total n(1) * n(2) * ... * n(k) ways to complete the entire task.
- Example that given purchasig 3 shirts, 4 pants and 2 shoes, the number of outfits is 24.
