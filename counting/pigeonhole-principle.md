# Pigeonhole Principle

Says that if k boxes, and have k+1 objects, then there is at least one box containing 2 or more objects. Called pigeonhole because it is explained in terms of pigeons and pigeonholes.

Examples
- for 367 people, at least 2 have the same birthdays
- for 27 words, at least 2 words start with the same letter

## Corollary 1
- has to do with functions
- suppose hae 2 sets: one with k + 1 and one with k, if have function _f_, then it can not be 1-to-1. there are more in the domain than the codomain

## Generalization
- suppose there are 7 objects, and 3 boxes.
- by principle, at least 1 will have more than 1 object
  - at least one box will have 3 objects. even if distribute evenly, there needs to be even distribution.
- if have N objects placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing "ceiling" N/k objects (ceiling of 7 / 6 is 3)

## Subsequence Definition
- example of application
  - every sequence of n^2 + 1 distinct real numbers contains subsequence of length n + 1 that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
