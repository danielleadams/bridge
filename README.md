# bridge

Dropping all my notes, questions, and other documentation from my Bridge Program journey in here.

## Topics Covered
- Computer Hardware
- Data Types
- Digital Data
- Discrete Math
- Functions
- Programming in C++

## Run Code
In order to compile and run the C++ files, run the following
```
$ cd programming/
$ g++ program-name.cpp -o output-name.out
$ ./program-name.out
```
The `.out` file ext ensures that it is not tracked by git.
