# Branching

In control flow, it is different from sequential because it performs different functions based on input.

## Chars - Lower or Upper
- asciitable.com
- integers and char digits are not the same

Includes:
- `if`
- `if/else`
- `switch` statements

## Switch statement
- _numeric-experssion_ must be of type
  - int (short int, int or long it)
  - char
  - bool
- the **case** labels must be constants (literals or named constants)
- if no case matches, then branches to **default**
  - if no default, then nothing happens
- if a branch takes control, control proceeds until break statement or ed of switch
