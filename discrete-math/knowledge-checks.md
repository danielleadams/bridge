# Knowledge Checks

### List the members of these sets. If there are no members, choose empty set.

```
{ x | x is a real number such that x^2 = 1 }

=> {-1, 1}
```

```
{ x | x is a positive integer less than 12 }

=> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
```

```
{ x | x is the square of an integer and x < 100 }

=> {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81}
```

```
{ x | x is an integer such that x^2 = 2 }

=> {}
```

### Determine whether the following sets are equal.

```
{1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5}, {1, 3, 5} => true
{{1}}, {1, {1}} => false
0, {0} => false
```

### What is the cardinality of the followin sets?

```
0 => 0
{0} => 1
{0, {0}, {0, {0}}} => 3
```

### Determine which sets are subsets of other sets

```
A = {2, 4, 6}
B = {2, 6}
C = {4, 6}
D = {4, 6, 8}

=> B and C are subsets of A; C is a subset of D
```

### List the subset of odd integers in a set of Z+ no exceeding 10

```
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
```

### List subset of months of a year whose names do not contain the letter `R` in the set of all months in the year.

```
{May, June, July, August}
```

### Let A be set of students living within one mile of school and B students that walk to class.

- A intersect B.
  - Set of students that both walk to school and live within 1 mile of school.
- A union B.
  - Set of students that walk to school or live within one mile.
- A \ B
  - Set of students who live within one mile but do not walk to class.
- B \ A
  - Set of students who walk to class and do not live within a mile.

### Find the following

```
A = {a, b, c, d, e}
B = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}

A intersect B => {a, b, c, d, e}
A \ B => {}
B \ A => {f, g, h}

A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
C = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

A intersect B intersect C => {4, 6}
A union B => {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
(A union B) intersect C => {4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
(A intersect B) union C => {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

```

### Solve for A and B given

```
A \ B = {1, 5, 7, 8}
B \ A = {2, 10}
A intersect = {3, 6, 9}

=> A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; B = {2, 3, 6, 9, 10}
```
